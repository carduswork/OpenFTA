Operation
</b><br>
A copy of the clipboard contents, usually a sub-tree of gates and 
events, is added as a child of the currently selected fault tree 
symbol. If this operation would cause the fault tree to become invalid,
then an error dialog is displayed and the operation is aborted. The 
<i>Paste</i> operation can be repeated several times, since the clipboard 
retains its contents until they are overwritten by a <i><a href = "CopyFTA.html">
Copy</a></i> or <i><a href = "CutFTA.html">Cut</a></i> operation.
