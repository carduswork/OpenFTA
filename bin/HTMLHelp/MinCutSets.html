Operation
</b><br>
This menu option is used to initiate the generation of the minimal cut
sets for a fault tree. 
<br>
When invoked, a minimal cut sets dialog
with the title <i>OpenFTA: Minimal Cut Sets - Algebraic Method</i> is presented. 
This dialog is used to specify whether 
or not to use the minimal cut sets already on file and to specify which
orders of minimal cut sets should be generated.
<br>
If a minimal cut sets file already exists then the <i>Use minimal cut sets
on file</i> check box is selected and the directory path to the minimal
cut sets file is displayed, as well as the number and order of the 
available minimal cut sets.
<br>
If the <i>Generate all minimal cut sets</i> radio button is selected, all 
orders of minimal cut sets for the fault tree will be calculated. If 
the <i>Limit minimal cut set order to</i> radio button is selected, only 
minimal cut sets up to a specific order will be generated. The required
maximum cut set order is specified using the spin buttons (the two, 
back-to-back arrows).
<br>
On activation of the <i>OK</i> button, OpenFTA displays a working dialog 
and carries out the minimal cut set generation, using the parameters 
requested. The <i>Stop</i> button on the working dialog may be pressed to 
abort the generation of the minimal cut sets.
<br>
Note that the generation of minimal cut sets may take a long time for 
very large trees, when large order minimal cut sets are required.
<br>
On activation of the <i>Cancel</i> button, the operation is aborted and the 
dialog is removed.
<br>
On activation of the <i>Help</i> button, context sensitive help information is
displayed.
<br>
On completion of the operation, a Qualitative Report is generated (to a
file named: <code>&ltfault tree name&gt.mcs</code>) and displayed in a dialog. The 
report consists of:
<ul>
<li>the name of the file used to store the fault tree analysed in
this report
<li>the date and time of the report's creation
<li>the method used to calculate the minimal cut sets
<li>the number of unique primary events in the fault tree, including those
in any transfer trees
<li>the range of cut set orders possible for the fault tree
a list of the minimal cut sets separated into the orders that have been
located
<li>a table titled Qualitative Importance Analysis. The table represents 
the distribution of the number of minimal cut sets found per order of 
cut sets that are possible for the fault tree.
