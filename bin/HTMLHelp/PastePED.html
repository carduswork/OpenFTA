Pre-conditions
</b><br>
Text has previously been <i>Cut</i> or <i>Copied</i> onto the clipboard or, to paste into
the <i>Probability</i> fields, data in a decimal or exponential format has previously
been <i>Cut</i> or <i>Copied</i> onto the clipboard.
</p><p><b>
Operation
</b><br>
A copy of the clipboard contents is added into one of the text fields where the cursor
is currently situated. If text is currently highlighted the clipboard contents replace
the highlighted text. If non numerical data is pasted into the <i>Probability</i> field, white 
space will be pasted instead. The 
<i>Paste</i> operation can be repeated several times, since the clipboard 
retains its contents until they are overwritten by a <i><a href = "CopyPED.html">
Copy</a></i> or <i><a href = "CutPED.html">Cut</a></i> operation.
