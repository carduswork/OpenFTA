Operation
</b><br>
Used to store the currently displayed primary events database to a file. On activation, if the database has been previously stored, then it is stored to the same file. This overwrites any previous contents held within the file. The file name is of the form <code>&ltname of database&gt.ped</code>.
<br>
If the database has not been stored previously, then the Save operation acts in the same way as the <i><a href = "SaveAsPED.html">Save As</a></i> operation.
<br>
If the output file does not have write access, then an error dialog is displayed. In order to save the database the permissions must be changed or the <i><a href = "SaveAsPED.html">Save As</a></i> operation must be used to store the database to a file with a different name and/or directory location.
