Operation
</b><br>
The dialog consists of:
<ul>
<li>a <i>Files of Type</i> drop down list: this shows the filter currently in use. A filter is a way of limiting the types of files displayed in the dialog. The default filter is currently displayed which means that only files with the specified extension will be displayed in the dialog.  

<li>a scrollable list of Directories and Files: lists the files and directories below the current working directory. Movement between directories is performed by multi-clicking on any directory in the list. 
 
<li>a <i>File name</i> text field: contains the filename of the currently selected file.
</ul>
File selection takes place by either:
<ul>
<li>multi-clicking on the required file
<li>selecting the file and activating the <i>Open</i> button
<li>completing the selection text field and activating the <i>Open</i> button.
</ul>
On activation of the <i>Open</i> button, the required file operation is 
attempted and if successful the dialog is removed from the screen.
<br>
On activation of the <i>Cancel</i> button, the file operation is aborted and 
the dialog is removed from the screen.
