Operation
</b><br>
Used to store the open fault tree to a named file. The file name is 
usually of the form <code>&ltname of tree&gt.fta</code>.
<br>
On activation a dialog box titled <i>Save</i>, is displayed. 
For more details on the use of this dialog 
read the section titled <a href = "fta_dialog_file_selector.html">
File Selection Dialog</a>.
<br>
Note that on activation of the <i>Save</i> button the fault tree is stored to 
the currently selected file and the <i>Save</i> dialog is 
removed. 
<br>
If the output file does not have write access, then an error dialog 
is displayed. In order to save the fault tree the permissions must be 
changed or the <i>Save As...</i> operation must be used to store the fault tree 
to a file with a different name and/or directory location.
