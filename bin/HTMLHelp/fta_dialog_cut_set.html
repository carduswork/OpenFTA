       Cut Set dialog
</h1><hr><p>
       This dialog allows the creation of minimum cut sets by the 
       Algebraic method which reduces the tree logically to obtain 
       the minimum cut sets.
</p><p>
       A cut set is a set of primary events, which, if they all occur,
       will cause the top event (system failure) to occur. A minimum
       cut set is a cut set which has no subsets which are cut sets.
</p><p>
       A minimum cut set which contains x primary events is called an
       x-order cut set.

       This dialog consists of:
<ul>
<li>   Use minimal cut sets on file... check box: If a cut set file already exists for 
       the tree, selecting this toggle will cause the previously calculated
       cut sets to be used. If this toggle is not selected, the minimum
       cut sets will be calculated and written to the <code>&lttree&gt.mcs</code> file.

<li>   If the cut sets on file are limited to an order, and the cut sets
       to be generated are for a higher order, then only the cut sets
       of orders higher than those on file will be generated.

<li>   Generate all minimal cut sets radio button: When calculating minimum cut
       sets selection of this button will cause all orders of minimum
       cut set to be calculated. This can take a considerable amount of
       time for large trees with many primary events and gates.

<li>   Limit minimal cut set order to radio button: When calculating minimum
       cut sets selection of this button will cause only those cut sets
       of the specified order or lower to be calculated.

<li>       Maximum order: This enables the limiting of the cut set order. Change using the 
	spin buttons.
</ul>
