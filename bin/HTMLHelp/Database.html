Pre-conditions
</b><br>
The fault tree and primary events database have been saved.
</p>
<p><b>
Operation
</b><br>
Associate the events database displayed in the OpenPED window with 
that currently displayed on the OpenFTA canvas. Any existing 
association between a tree and a database is overridden.
As a consequence of forming an association between a tree and a 
database, the data displayed in the tree's primary events will be 
updated to be consistent with the database i.e. each primary event 
will display the description and probability corresponding to the 
events id.
