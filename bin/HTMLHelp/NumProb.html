Calculates the probability of occurrence of the top level event of the 
displayed fault tree and generates (and displays) an associated 
analysis report.

Pre-conditions
</b><br>
Fault tree has been saved, is valid and the minimal cut sets have been
generated.
</p><p><b>
Operation
</b><br>
Calculates the minimal cut set probabilities for the fault tree and the
probability of the top level event occurring (system failure).
<br>
On activation a <i>OpenFTA: Probabilities</i> dialog is displayed 
containing:
<ul>
<li>a statement of the total number of unique primary events in the 
displayed fault tree (including those in any transfer-in trees)

<li>a text field containing the directory path to the generated minimal cut
sets file

<li>a description of the file consisting of the number of minimal cut sets,
their maximum order and the date and time of file generation

<li>a <i>Use all minimal cut sets</i> radio button. If this is selected, then all 
the generated minimal cut sets are used in the numerical probabilities 
calculation

<li>a <i>Limit minimal cut set order to</i> radio button. This is only available 
if the <i>Use all minimal cut sets</i> radio button is not selected. This 
limits the order of the minimal cut sets used in the calculation to the
value chosen using the spin buttons (the two, back-to-back arrows)

<li>a <i>Number of terms</i> option which is altered through the use of spin buttons.
The option is provided in order to limit the number of terms used in 
the probability calculation. This uses a <b>series expansion</b> in which 
there are n terms each with <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> terms making a total number of 2<sup>n</sup> 
possible terms. By limiting the number of terms used, the calculation 
is speeded up at a cost of precision. In practice, the terms used get 
smaller rapidly and it is rarely necessary to go past the third term in
the calculations for a large tree

<li>a <i>Unit Time</i> text field. This text field stipulates unit time for which
the numerical probability is to be calculated. This is required if 
there are primary events whose probabilities have been entered into the
primary events database as a function of time (&lambda;-model), rather than 
as an absolute probability, (p-model). A default value will be 
displayed, but can be altered to suit experimental needs

<li>an <i>Estimated run time</i> statement. This is an estimate of how long the 
calculation will take, depending upon the parameters stipulated in the 
dialog.
</ul>
On activation of the <i>OK</i> button, a working dialog is displayed and the 
numerical probabilities calculation is initiated. The <i>Stop</i> button on 
the dialog may be pressed to abort the process at any time. 
<br>
On activation of the <i>Cancel</i> button, the procedure will be aborted and 
the <i>OpenFTA: Probabilities</i> dialog will be removed from the screen.
<br>
On activation of the <i>Help</i> button, a dialog containing context sensitive
help information will be displayed.
<br>
On completion of the operation, the <i>OpenFTA: Probabilities</i> dialog is
removed, a <i>Probability Report</i> is generated (to a file named: <code>&ltfault 
tree name&gt.prp</code>) and displayed in a dialog. The report consists of:
<ul>
<li>the name of the file used to store the fault tree analysed in
this report

<li>the date and time of the report's creation

<li>the number of unique primary events in the displayed fault tree 
(including those in any transfer-in trees)

<li>the number of minimal cut sets available for the fault tree

<li>the maximum order of the minimal cut sets available for use in the 
probability calculations for the displayed fault tree

<li>a statement of the order of minimal cut sets utilised in the 
probability calculations, if less than the maximum order available is 
used

<li>the unit time span used for the calculations

<li>a table titled <i>Minimal cut set probabilities</i>. This consists of a list 
of all the minimal cut sets and the probabilities of each and every 
event in a minimal cut set failing in order to cause the top level 
event to occur (system failure)

<li>the probability of the top level event occurring given the cut set 
probabilities calculated previously

<li>a table titled <i>Basic Event Analysis</i>. This contains a list of all the 
primary events in the fault tree and their failure contribution towards
the top level event occurring. This contribution is also stated as a 
percentage importance value for each primary event.
