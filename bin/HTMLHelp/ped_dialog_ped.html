<h1>Primary Events Database dialog</h1>
<hr>
<p>
       This dialog allows the entry and modification of the Primary Events
       in the currently opened <a href="ped_events_database.html">Primary Events Database</a>.
</p><p>
       All the currently defined Primary Events are identified in the
       selection list to the left of the dialog. Selecting an event causes
       it's details to be displayed in the fields to the right of the dialog.
</p><p>
       The Primary Events of the opened database are held in memory, and
       are only committed to disc when the 'Save' or 'Save As...' options
       are selected from the main menubar.
</p><p>
       An <i>Identifier</i> can be made up of alphanumeric characters, -, +, or
       _, and are constrained to 13 characters in length.
</p><p>
       Modifying the details of a selected Primary Event will only be
       actioned when the <i>Apply</i> button is pressed. The actions taken when
       apply is pressed are determined from the Identifer field of the
       Primary Event. Changing the <i>Identifier</i> for an event that does not 
       already exist in the database causes a new Primary Event to be 
       added to the memory resident copy of the database. 
</p><p>
       If the <i>Identifer</i> has not changed the current details will replace 
       those of the selected Primary Event in the memory resident copy
       of the database.
</p><p>
       The <i>Probability</i> field of the Primary Event allows the entry of
       probabilites in the range 0 to 1, with a precision to 6 decimal
       places. The probability is taken to be the absolute probability
       of failure unless the <i>By Unit Time</i> check box is selected. If
       the probability of failure is given in terms of Unit Time, the
       calculations of Fault Tree probabilities will take this into 
       account by prompting the user for a number of unit time intervals
       to perform the calculations over.
</p><p>
       The <i>probability</i> field allows entry in decimal or exponential
       form. In exponential form, an 'e' or an 'E' symbol can be entered.
</p><p>
       For <i>External</i> events the probability must be either 0 or 1.
</p><p>
       The <i>descriptive text</i> can be any printable character, including
       newlines.
</p><p>
       The <i>type</i> of the event can be modified by selecting the required
       radio button. If an event is Basic, External or Undeveloped it
       may not be changed to a Conditional type.
</p><p>
       The fields in the Primary Event may be cleared by pressing the
       <i>Cancel</i> button. Any existing modifications not applied will be
       lost.
