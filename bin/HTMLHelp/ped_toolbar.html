<h1>Toolbar</h1><hr>
<p>
    The toolbar provides shortcuts to selected menu options.
    The options are:
</p><p><b>
    New
</b><br>
<img src="images/new database.gif" border=0>
<br>
    This option is used to close the current Primary Events Database file, 
    and to open a new one. If the current Primary Events Database file has 
    not been saved, a warning dialog will be given to allow the action to 
    be aborted.
</p><p><b>
    Open 
</b><br>
<img src="images/open database.gif" border=0>
<br>
    This option is used to open an existing Primary Events Database file.
    An <i>Open</i> dialog will appear. Directories and files with the 
    *.ped extension in the current working directory are displayed 
    in the list.
</p><p><b>
    Save
</b><br>
<img src="images/save database.gif" border=0>
<br>
    This option is used to save the current Primary Events Database. If the
    Primary Events Database already has a file name (i.e it was loaded from
    a file, or has been previously saved) the database is saved to this
    file. NOTE: in this case, 'Save' does not prompt for confirmation. The
    file is immediately overwritten with the current Primary Events Database.
 </p><p>
    If the database does not already have a file name, 'Save' operates as
    'Save As...' on the File Menu.
</p><p><b>
    Print 
</b><br>
<img src="images/print database.gif" border=0>
<br>
    This option allows the printing of the currently open database. The
    database can be printed by any printer.
</p><p>
    A dialog appears to allow the selection of the page setup such as paper
    orientation. After pressing OK a new dialog appears. This dialog displays 
    all the printers known
    to the system from which to select the target printer, and the number
    of copies of the database to send to the printer.
