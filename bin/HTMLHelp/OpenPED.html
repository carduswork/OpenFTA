Operation
</b><br>
Used to open a primary events database that has been previously stored.
On activation, a dialog box titled <i>Open</i> is displayed. 
For more details on the use 
of this dialog read the section titled <a href = "fta_dialog_file_selector.html">
File Selection Dialog</a>.
<br>
Note that on activation of the <i>OK</i> button the currently selected file is
opened and the <i>Open</i> dialog is 
removed. If a file with an incorrect format is selected
then a new empty database is displayed.
<br>
If a database has been modified without saving, then confirmation is 
requested before OpenFTA proceeds with the <i>Open</i> Operation. 
<br>
On successful completion of the operation the newly chosen database is
displayed in the OpenPED's window.
