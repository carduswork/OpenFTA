On selection of the View option a slide right menu is displayed 
containing three options: <i>Qualitative Report, Probability Report and 
Monte Carlo Report</i>. By choosing any one of the available reports, a 
<i>OpenFTA: View Report</i> dialog containing the associated information is
displayed.
<br>
Note that for the Qualitative Report to be available for viewing, the 
<a href = "MinCutSets.html">Minimal Cut Sets</a> must have been generated. 
For the Probability Report, the <a href = "NumProb.html">Numerical Probability</a> 
analysis must have been performed and for the Monte Carlo Report, 
the <a href = "Monte.html">Monte Carlo Simulation</a> must have been 
performed. If the appropriate analyses that generate the reports have 
not been done, then the relevant options are greyed-out.
