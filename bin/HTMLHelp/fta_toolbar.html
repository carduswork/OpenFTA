				<h1>Toolbar</h1>
    <p>
    The toolbar provides shortcuts to selected menu options. The buttons 
    are divided into two groups, file menu shortcuts and edit menu shortcuts.
    </p><p>
    The file menu shortcuts are: 
</p>
<p><b>    New
</b><br>
<img src="images/new tree.gif" border=0>
<br>
    This option is used to close any current Fault Tree and start editing
    a new Fault Tree. If the current Fault Tree has not been saved, a 
    warning will be given to allow the action to be aborted. The current
    Fault Tree is cleared from memory, and a new top level event is created.
</p><p><b>  
    Open
</b><br>
<img src="images/open tree.gif" border=0>
<br>
    This option is used to open an existing Fault Tree file. An open
    dialog will appear. Directories and files with the extension "*.fta"
 in the current working directory are displayed in the list. The dialog
    operates in the standard Windows manner.
</p><p> 
    To open the database, double click on any Primary Event in a
    OpenFTA tree. If the tree has an associated database it will be
    opened for editing. If no database is associated with the tree, a new
    database will be opened for editing.
</p><p><b>
    Save
</b><br>  
<img src="images/save tree.gif" border=0>
<br>
    This option is used to save the current Fault Tree. If the
    Fault Tree already has a file name (i.e it was loaded from a file, or
    has been previously saved) the tree is saved to this file. NOTE: in this
    case, 'Save' does not prompt for confirmation. The file is immediately
    overwritten with the current Fault Tree. 
</p><p> 
    If the tree does not already have a file name, 'Save' operates as
    the 'Save As...' option of the file menu.
</p><p><b>
    Print
</b><br>
<img src="images/print tree.gif" border=0>
</b><br>
    This option allows the printing of the currently edited tree. 
 </p><p>
    A dialog appears to allow the selection of page setup such as whether the
page should be printed in Portrait or Landscape orientation. After clicking OK 
another dialog appears. The dialog displays all the printers known to the
    system from which to select the target printer, and the number of
    copies of the tree to send to the printer. 
</p><p>
   
    The edit menu shortcuts are:  
</p><p><b>    
    Cut
</b><br>
<img src="images/cut sub-tree.gif" border=0>
<br>
    The selected item, and its descendents if it has any, is removed from the
    tree and placed on the clipboard. Any item previously on the clipboard is lost.
</p><p><b>
    Copy
 </b><br>
<img src="images/copy sub-tree.gif" border=0>
<br>
    A copy of the selected item, and its descendents if it has any, is placed
    on the clipboard. It remains in the tree. Any item previously on the clipboard
    is lost.
 </p><p><b>
    Paste
 </b><br>
<img src="images/paste sub-tree.gif" border=0>
<br>
    A copy of the subtree stored on the clipboard is added as a child of
    the selected item. If this is impossible, an error message is given.
    The subtree remains on the clipboard, so that it may be pasted several
    times.
 </p><p><b>
    Delete
 </b><br>
<img src="images/delete sub-tree.gif" border=0>
<br>
    The currently selected subtree is deleted.
</p><p><b>
    Link
</b><br>
<img src="images/link.gif" border=0>
<br>
    The currently selected item is linked with the currently selected
    Primary Event. The item is redisplayed with the Id and descriptive
    text of the Primary Event.
</p><p>
   
    The view menu shortcuts are:
</p><p><b>  
    Zoom In
 </b><br>
<img src="images/zoom in.gif" border=0>
<br>
    The tree view is zoomed in by 10%.
</p><p><b>
    Zoom Out
 </b><br>
<img src="images/zoom out.gif" border=0>
<br>
    The tree view is zoomed out by 10%.
