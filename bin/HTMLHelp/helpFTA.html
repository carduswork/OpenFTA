<h1>Help on help</h1><hr><p>

Help pages may be accessed in two ways:
<ol>
  <li>From the Help option in the main menu bar
<br>
     This provides a number of Help topics directly, and an Index option.
     Selecting <a href="IndexFTA.html">Index</a> will open your current default internet browser giving a
     hypertext list of all help topics available.

  <li>From the Help buttons in the dialogs
<br>
     Pressing HELP in a dialog will cause the relevent Help page to appear.
     These Help pages are also available through the index.
