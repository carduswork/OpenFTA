On activation, the selected fault tree symbol and the sub tree below it
are shifted one place to the left. The layout of the fault tree is 
handled automatically. The operation is available for purely aesthetic 
reasons and has no effect upon the analysis of the tree.

Note that Conditioning Events may not be shifted and if this operation 
is attempted an error dialog is displayed.
