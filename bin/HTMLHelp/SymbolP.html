Pre-conditions
</b><br>
A symbol on the canvas is selected.
</p><p><b>
Operation
</b><br>
Selecting a symbol from the palette adds the chosen symbol as the right
most child of the symbol selected on the canvas.
<br>
Note that the tree layout is managed automatically and that the symbol 
palette is context sensitive and thus prevents illogical additions to 
the tree by greying out inappropriate symbols.
<br>
The Symbol Palette is made up of events, gates and transfer symbols.
</p><p><b>
Event Symbols:
</b><br>
<img src="images/intermediate event.gif" border=0>Intermediate Event: Used to specify a failure event that occurs due to 
one or more causes acting through logic gates below it in the fault 
tree.
<br>
<img src="images/basic initiating event.gif" border=0>Basic Initiating Event: Used to specify a failure event that does not 
require any further development i.e. it is a `leaf' of the fault tree 
and has no gates or events below it in the tree.
<br>
<img src="images/undeveloped event.gif" border=0>Undeveloped Event: Used to specify a failure event that is not 
developed as far as it could be, either because the event is of no 
importance in this fault tree, or because there is not enough 
information available.
<br>
<img src="images/external event.gif" border=0>External Event: Used to specify a failure event that is expected to 
occur and is therefore not directly a failure. The event can <u>only</u> have 
a probability attached to it of 0 (Failed) or 1 (Working).
<br>
<img src="images/conditioning event.gif" border=0>Conditioning Event: Used to specify certain conditions upon any logic 
gate. There are two states for this type of event: <i>Analysed</i> - a 
probability is assigned to the event and it forms part of the analysis 
of the tree; <i>Not Analysed</i> - no probability is assigned to the event and
it's role is to add pertinent comments. This type of event is mainly 
used in conjunction with the Priority And and Inhibit gates and is 
displayed to the right of a gate.
</p><p><b>
Logic Gate Symbols:
</b><br>
<img src="images/and gate.gif" border=0>And Gate: Used to show that the output fault will only happen if all of
the inputs occur.
<br>
<img src="images/or gate.gif" border=0>Or Gate: Used to show that the output fault will only occur if one or 
more of the input faults take place.
<br>
<img src="images/priority and gate.gif" border=0>Priority And Gate: The output only occurs if the input faults take 
place in a certain order. The sequence of events is usually stated in a
conditioning event, situated to the right of the gate.
<br>
<img src="images/exclusive or gate.gif" border=0>Exclusive Or Gate: The output only occurs if exactly one of the input 
faults happens.
<br>
<img src="images/inhibit gate.gif" border=0>Inhibit Gate: The output fault only occurs if the <u>single</u> input happens 
and the attached Conditioning Event is satisfied. The gate is in 
effect a special case <i>And</i> gate.
</p><p><b>
Transfer Symbols:
</b><br>
These symbols are used to modularise a fault tree. For example, if 
there is a sequence of events that occurs in more than one place in the
fault tree, then it can be removed and placed into a separate sub-tree
and just referenced by the main fault tree.
<br>
<img src="images/transfer in.gif" border=0>Transfer In: Used to depict a sub-tree that has been stored in a 
separate .fta file. The name of the file is used as the identifier for 
the transfer in symbol. Note that the .fta suffix is added 
automatically to the file name.
<br>
<img src="images/transfer out.gif" border=0>Transfer Out: Used to depict that the tree shown below a transfer out 
symbol is a sub-tree of a fault tree that is stored in a different 
file. The name of the sub-tree may be used as the identifier for the 
transfer out symbol. Note that the .fta suffix is added automatically 
to the file name.
