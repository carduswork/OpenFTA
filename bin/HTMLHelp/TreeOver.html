On activation a resizeable dialog entitled <i>OpenFTA: Tree</i> is 
displayed. The dialog contains a scaled image of the fault tree 
currently displayed on the OpenFTA canvas area. Symbols can be 
selected on the overview causing them to become centered on 
OpenFTA's canvas area. This aids navigation around large fault 
trees.
