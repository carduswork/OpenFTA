Pre-conditions
</b><br>
A primary event is selected on the OpenFTA canvas area. The database
displayed in the OpenPED window is associated with the fault tree 
depicted on the canvas and an event in the <i>Primary Events</i> list is 
selected.
</p>
<p><b>
Operation
</b><br>
On activation, the currently selected event in the fault tree is linked
to the selected primary event in the database. This causes the <i>ID, 
Probability</i> value and <i>Description</i> for the selected fault tree event 
symbol to be displayed on the canvas. 
<br>
If the <i>Type</i> of event in the database differs from that of the selected
event in the tree, then confirmation is requested before the action is
completed. On completion the symbol on the canvas is changed to the 
type held within the database.
<br>
Note that a <i>Link</i> operation cannot be undone using the <i>Undo</i> option.
