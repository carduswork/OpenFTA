Calculates the probability of occurrence of the top level event of the 
displayed fault tree and generates (and displays) an associated 
analysis report.

Pre-conditions
</b><br>
The fault tree has been saved and is valid.
</p>
<p><b>
Operation
</b><br>
Determines the probability of the top event occurring by using a Monte
Carlo Simulation (statistical) algorithm. Also determines 
(statistically) the cut sets and minimal cut sets, but note that not 
all cut sets may be determined.
<br>
On activation a <i>OpenFTA: Monte Carlo</i> dialog is displayed containing:
<ul>
<li>a statement of the total number of unique primary events in the 
displayed fault tree (including those in any transfer-in trees)

<li>a <i>Number of simulations</i> text field. This contains the number of Monte 
Carlo Simulations that will be performed upon the fault tree. A default
value will be displayed, but can be altered. Since a random number 
generator is used in this method, if the number of simulations is 
increased, the accuracy of the results obtained will increase, but with
the penalty of a longer execution time for the calculations

<li>a Unit Time text field. This text field stipulates the number of unit 
times for which each Monte Carlo Simulation run is to simulate. This is
only required if there are primary events whose probabilities have been
entered into the primary events database as a function of time 
(l-model), rather than as a function of probability (p-model). A 
default value will be displayed, but can be altered to suit 
experimental needs.

<li>an Estimated run time statement. This is an estimate of how long the 
calculation will take, depending upon the parameters stipulated in the
dialog.
</ul>

On activation of the <i>Ok</i> button, a working dialog is displayed and the 
Monte Carlo Simulation is actioned. The <i>Stop</i> button on the dialog may 
be pressed to abort the simulation at any time. 
<br>
On activation of the <i>Cancel</i> button, the procedure is aborted and the 
<i>OpenFTA: Monte Carlo</i> dialog removed from the screen.
<br>
On activation of the <i>Help</i> button, context sensitive help information is
displayed.
<br>
On completion of the simulation, the <i>OpenFTA: Monte Carlo</i> dialog is
removed from the screen, a <i>Monte Carlo Report</i> is generated (to a file 
named: <code>&ltfault tree name&gt.mrp</code>) and displayed in a dialog. The report 
consists of:
<ul>
<li>the name of the file used to store the fault tree analysed in
this report

<li>the date and time of the report's creation

<li>the number of unique primary events in the displayed fault tree 
(including any transfer-in trees)

<li>the number of Monte Carlo Simulation runs that have been performed upon
the displayed fault tree

<li>the number of unit times simulated for each run

<li>the number of system failures that occurred, (occurrences of the top 
level event) due to primary events being failed during the calculations

<li>the probability of at least one component in the tree failing during 
the simulation

<li>the probability of the top level event occurring

<li>a table of the cut sets found during the simulations. 	Each row of the
table consists of: the cut set, the number of failures attributed to it
in the simulations, the estimated probability of one of the events in 
that cut set occurring and the percentage importance of the cut set in
comparison to the other cut sets found

<li>a table titled <i>Compressed</i>. This is the same as the previous table, but 
those cut sets which are less minimal versions of others are subsumed 
by the more minimalistic ones. The other fields such as the estimated 
probability are adjusted accordingly

<li>a table titled <i>Primary Event Analysis</i>. This contains a list of all of the
primary events in the fault tree and their failure contribution towards
the top level event occurring. This contribution is also stated as a 
percentage importance value for each primary event.
