Operation
</b><br>
Used to open a fault tree that has been previously stored. On 
activation, a dialog box titled <i>Open</i> is displayed. 
For more details on the use of this dialog read
the section titled <a href = "fta_dialog_file_selector.html">File Selection Dialog</a>.
<br>
Note that on activation of the <i>OK</i> button, the currently selected file 
is opened and the <i>Open</i> dialog is removed. If files 
containing data in an incorrect format are selected then, an error 
dialog is displayed.
<br>
If a fault tree has been modified without saving, then confirmation is
requested before OpenFTA proceeds with the <i>Open</i> Operation. 
<br>
On successful completion of the operation, the newly chosen fault tree 
is displayed.
