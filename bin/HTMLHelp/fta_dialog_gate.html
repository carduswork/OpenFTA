<h1>
	 Gate dialog
</h1><hr><p>
       This dialog allows the entry and modification of identifier and
       gate type for a selected Gate.
</p><p>
       An Identifier can be made up of alphanumeric characters, -, +, or 
       _, and are constrained to 13 characters in length.
</p><p>
       The Gate type can be one of AND, OR, XOR, PRIORITY_AND and
       INHIBIT. At present the INHIBIT gate has no influence on the
       analysis performed on a Fault Tree.
