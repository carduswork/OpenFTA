Used to store the open primary events database to a named file. The 
file name is of the form <code>&ltname of database&gt.ped</code>.
<br>
On activation a dialog box titled <i>Save</i>, is displayed. 
For more details on the use
of this dialog read the section titled <a href = "fta_dialog_file_selector.html">
