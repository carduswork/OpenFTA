Operation
</b><br>
If set, on activation of the <i><a href = "ApplyPED.html">Apply</a></i> button, 
the current event will be 
entered into the primary events database as a dormant event.
<br>
<i>Dormant</i> events are special case primary events. They may fail with no 
visible external effects. An example is the failure of a filament in a
warning lamp - if the light is not on, then it would normally be 
assumed that the system which it is monitoring does not require a 
warning to be issued. However, it could be that both the lamp filament
and the subsystem it monitors have failed.
<br>
In OpenFTA, the dormant event is treated the same as any other 
primary event, with the exception that the symbol on the canvas is 
drawn with a double line.
