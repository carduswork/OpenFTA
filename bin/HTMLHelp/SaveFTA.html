Operation
</b><br>
Used to store the currently displayed fault tree to a file. On activation, if the fault tree has been previously stored, then the tree is stored to the same file. This overwrites any previous contents held within the file. The file name is of the form <code>&ltname of tree&gt.fta</code>
<br>
If the tree has not been stored previously then the <i>Save</i> operation acts in the same way as the <i><a href = "SaveAsFTA.html">Save As...</a></i> operation.
<br>
If the output file does not have write access, then an error dialog is displayed. In order to save the fault tree the permissions must be changed or the <i><a href = "SaveAsFTA.html">Save As...</a></i> operation must be used to store the fault tree to a file with a different name and/or directory location.
