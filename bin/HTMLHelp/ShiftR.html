On activation, the selected fault tree symbol and the sub tree below it
are shifted one place to the right. The layout of the fault tree is 
handled automatically. The operation is available for purely aesthetic 
reasons and has no effect upon the analysis of the tree.

Note that Conditioning Events may not be shifted and if this is 
attempted an error dialog is displayed.
