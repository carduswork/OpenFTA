	 Monte Carlo dialog
</h1><hr><p>
       This dialog allows the independent means of obtaining the 
       probability of the top level event (system failure) based 
       upon the user-supplied probabilities of primary event failures.
</p><p>
       The Monte Carlo simulation randomly simulates occurrences of
       the failure of primary events and calculating whether the top
       level event would fail with the probabilities given. Only trials
       in which at least one primary event occurs are simulated.
</p><p>
       This dialog consists of:
<ul>
<li>   <i>Number of simulations</i>: The number of trials on the tree that will
       be performed.

<li>   <i>Unit time</i>: If primary event probabilities have been entered as
       occurring per Unit Time, a number of unit times over which
       Monte Carlo simulation calculations are to be based must be 
       entered.

<li>   <i>Estimated run time</i>: An estimate of the amount of time that the
       Monte Carlo simulation will take.
