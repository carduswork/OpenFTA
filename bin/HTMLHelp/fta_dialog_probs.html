<h1>Probabilities dialog</h1><hr><p>

       This dialog allows the calculation of the probability of the
       top level event (system failure) based upon the user-supplied
       probabilities of primary event failures.

       This dialog consists of:
<ul>
<li>   <i>Generate all minimal cut sets</i> radio button: When calculating probabilities
       selection of this button will cause all minimum
       cut set to be used in the calculation. 

<li>   <i>Limit minimal cut set order to</i> radio button: When calculating probabilities
       selection of this button will cause only those cut sets
       of the specified order or lower to be used in the calculation.

<li>   <i>Maximum order</i>: Allows the limiting order for cut sets used in the
       calculation, up to the maximum order allowed, to be entered.

<li>   Number of terms</i>: The calculation of the probabilities uses a
       series expansion. The series used has n terms, each of which has
       <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> sub terms (giving 2^n terms in all). In practice 
	 the terms
       get smaller rapidly, and it is rarely necessary to go past the
       third term for a large tree. It is advised that the default
       two terms is calculated first, progressing to higher terms
       if required.

<li>   <i>Unit time</i>: If primary event probabilities have been entered as
       occurring per Unit Time, a number of unit times over which
       the calculation of the probability of the top level event occurring
       must be entered.

<li>   <i>Estimated run time</i>: A estimate of the amount of time that the
       calculation of the probabilities will take.
