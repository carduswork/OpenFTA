Operation

On activation a slide right menu is displayed containing three options:
<i>Qualitative Report..., Probability Report...</i> and <i>Monte Carlo Report...</i>
</br>
By choosing any one of the available reports, a dialog titled 
<i>Print</i> is displayed. For more details on the use of 
this dialog read the section titled <a href = "fta_dialog_print.html">Print Dialog</a>.
<br> 
Note that if the appropriate analyses that generate the reports have 
not been performed, then the relevant options are greyed-out. For the 
Qualitative Report to be available for printing, the <a href = 
"MinCutSets.html">Minimal Cut Sets</a>
must have been generated. For the Probability Report, the <a href = "
NumProb.html">Numerical Probability </a>analysis must have been carried out 
and for the Monte Carlo Report, the <a href = "Monte.html">Monte Carlo Simulation</a>
 must have been performed.
