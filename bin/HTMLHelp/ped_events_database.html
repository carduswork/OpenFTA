    <h1>Events Database</h1><hr>
<p>
    Event definitions are stored in an Events Database. This allows the same
    primary event to occur in several places in a fault tree and, because
    databases may be shared between trees, in several trees.
</p><p>
    At any time there is a current database, stored in memory, which contains
    events available to the current fault tree. Each fault tree has a
    database file associated with it, which is loaded when the tree is loaded,
    and saved when the tree is saved.
</p><p>
    An events database contains definitions of
<ul>
<li>Basic events
<li>External events
<li>Undeveloped events
<li>Conditions (analysed)
<li>Conditions (not analysed)
</ul></p><p>
    In addition to type, each event has associated with it
<ul>
<li>ID          - a string of up to 13 characters
<li>Description - a textual description of the conditions under which
                      the event is true. This is displayed within the event
                      symbol in diagram.
<li>Probability - a numerical value representing the probability that the
                      event occurs in one test cycle. This is used in
                      Probabilities Analysis and Monte-Carlo analysis.
</ul></p><p>
    Unanalysed Conditions are treated simply as comments, and are not
    involved in analysis. Analysed conditions are treated as events, with
    a probability, and are included in analysis on a par with other event
    types.
